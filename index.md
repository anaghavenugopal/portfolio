**Mobility Analyst · Transport Planner · Traffic Engineer**

I work at the intersection of **data, infrastructure and people**, using quantitative tools to design transport systems that are efficient *and* equitable. My projects combine discrete choice modelling, optimisation, geospatial analysis and accessibility metrics with a strong focus on shared mobility, public transport and vulnerable user groups.

## 👋 About

I’m trained in transportation systems with experience across:

- **Shared mobility & MaaS** – analysing bikeshare, e-scooter and car-sharing data, and their integration with public transport.
- **Transport planning & traffic engineering** – corridor and network design, signal optimisation, and multi-modal evaluation.
- **Human-centred & equity-focused mobility** – accessibility for elderly users, gender-responsive planning, and inclusive service design.

I’m currently looking for roles as a **Mobility Analyst**, **Transport Planner** or **Traffic/Transport Engineer**, where I can support data-driven planning, modelling and evaluation of sustainable mobility solutions.

## 🏗️ Selected Projects

### 1. Shared Mobility at Mobility Points in Munich (Master’s Thesis)

**Keywords:** shared mobility, micromobility, regression, geospatial analysis  

- Analysed **bikeshare, e-scooter and car-sharing usage** around planned and existing mobility points in Munich.  
- Combined shared mobility data with **PT access, demographics, POIs, bike infrastructure and weather** on a grid level.  
- Built **stepwise and lasso regression models** to understand which built-environment factors drive usage near mobility points.  
- Identified differences in how bikes, scooters and car-sharing respond to PT accessibility, land use and population structure.

### 2. Integrated Transport Planning for Göttingen

**Keywords:** urban road network, ring roads, signal control, PT network design  

- Developed and evaluated **two ring-road concepts** to reduce through-traffic in Göttingen’s city centre.  
- Used **macro- and microscopic models** to assess volumes, V/C ratios, queues and delays at key intersections.  
- Designed improved **signal plans** (cycle times, phasing, grouping) to reach acceptable LOS with lower queues and emissions.  
- Proposed a **simplified public transport network** aligned with major OD flows and centre traffic-calming measures.

### 3. Discrete Choice Methods – UAM Airport Shuttle & Car-Sharing Tariffs

**Keywords:** discrete choice modelling, SP survey, multinomial & nested logit  

- Designed a **stated-preference survey** to study mode choice between private car, ride-hailing, PT and UAM as an airport shuttle.  
- Specified and estimated **multinomial logit models** to derive value-of-time and trade-offs between cost, time and reliability.  
- Analysed **car-sharing payment scheme preferences** using factor analysis and **nested / ordered logit models**.

### 4. Accessibility to Recreational Green Spaces for the Elderly

**Keywords:** accessibility, elderly, GIS, equity  

- Compared **Stuttgart and Hannover** in terms of how well elderly residents can reach recreational and green spaces.  
- Built **walk and PT-based catchments** in GIS and computed indicators such as share of elderly within service areas.  
- Aggregated indicators into a **composite accessibility index**, highlighting spatial inequalities and data gaps.

**Keywords:** MILP, TSP, regression, algorithms  

- Formulated and solved an **MILP** for bicycle production planning with budget, capacity and logical constraints.  
- Implemented **TSP heuristics** (nearest neighbour and simulated annealing) to study runtime vs solution quality up to 5 000 nodes.  
- Fitted **linear and quadratic models** for traffic fundamental diagrams and compared error metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, R²).
